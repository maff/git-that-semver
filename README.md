## TODOs

- better error handling on missing variables
- a default config file which can be partially overridden and acts as a template/living documentation
- dynamic loading of SCM adapters
- dynamic loading of version strategies OR removing strategy alltogether as we don't need a container strategy for the moment
- different output formats (JSON)
  - writing to a destination file instead of stdout would allow us to output debug logs
- config file as YAML? TOML is nice but not as widely used and a bit weird
